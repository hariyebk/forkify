# Forkify 

Forkify is a project created as part of an Advanced JavaScript course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by instructor Jonas Schmedtmann. It is a recipe app built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in JavaScript. It allows users to search for and bookmark recipes from a database of over 1 million recipes.
